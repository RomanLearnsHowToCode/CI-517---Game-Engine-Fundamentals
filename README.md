# CI-517---Game-Engine-Fundamentals
A game engine feature added for an provided game engine / C++ &amp; SDL 2.0


Please be aware that we have been provided with an Game Engine in C++, we had to create an additional engine feature.

Mine files are ACHIEVEMENT ENGINE .CPP and .H. I had to make many changes in the TEST folder content.
